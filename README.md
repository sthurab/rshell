# rshell

This is our README file.

This program will emulate the bash shell program by printing out a command prompt and reading in a command on one line.

The test command, as well as its symbolic equivalent [] the square brackets have been added as functionality. This command returns 0 (TRUE) if the test succeeds and 1 (FALSE) if the test fails. This command can also be used for writing conditions that can be combines with the AND operator && and the OR operator || to write more complex bash command structures.

The precedence operators, parentheses(),  have been added as functionality. They can be used to change the precedence of the returns of the connectors, and chains of connectors.
